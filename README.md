# Face Recognition Ultra
A Python program to turn a JSON file full of exam materials into GUI Flashcards to memorize and practice them easily.

# Feature:
- Turns a formatted JSON file into GUI Flashcards
- Perfect for exam preparation
- C and W buttons for each flashcard: C removes the flashcard entirely, W makes you retest yourself with the same question after a couple of flashcards
- Show answer button
- Previous button: to check the previous flashcards in case you need a review

# Tech Stack:
- PyQt5
- Json

# Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Marvell456/Json-to-Flashcard.git

2. Create a "flashcards.json" file in the same folder

3. Use ChatGPT or any other AI to make the flashcards (based on your exam materials, into the flashcards.json example's format)

4. Run the program:
   python main.py

# Future Improvements
- Add a personal AI within the program that turns PDF materials into the desired JSON format
- Have personalized learning strategies for each person (modifiable)
- Have more tweakable settings to make the learning session unique every single time

# Why I Built This
I built this program to help me study for the Grade 9 Finals Exam. Update: I inserted all of the PDF materials for every subject into ChatGPT, formatted everything into the desired JSON format. Learned with this program, an hour every day for a week. And gained 90+ out of 100 for all of my exams in all subjects 😎😎😎
